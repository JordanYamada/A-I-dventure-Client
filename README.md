## Description

Using OpenAI's ChatGPT and Dall-E, Users are able to create a choose-your-own-adventure story. Each choice prompts a randomly generated continuation of the story, as well as a generated image. Completed stories are stored in the Library so that the User can browse through the pages of their past adventures. These pages may even be individually saved into a collection of favorite memories.
